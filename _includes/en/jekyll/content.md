[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) is a static site generator.  It uses
a system of templates, and source files written in Markdown, HTML, CSS, Liquid, etc.
to build a static site built out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Because it is "blog-aware",
Jekyll allows you to quickly create blog posts by simply writing your posts in the
correct folder.

Static sites can be served cheaply with good performance.
