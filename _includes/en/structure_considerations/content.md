There are a few things to consider before building your site and book:
- consider which parts of your content will appear in book and on site
- break up the content into small blocks based on if or where it will appear in different publications
  - for example, an introductory paragraph might appear on the About page of your site, the Introduction of your book or in the speaker notes of a presentation.  It should be in a separate block than other introductory content that might appear in other parts of your materials
- take advantage of Jekyll's collections to put content together that can be iterated over
  - for example, chapters of your book might be organized into Jekyll collections so that you can simply iterate through them on your site
